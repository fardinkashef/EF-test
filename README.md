# FER Test

The Facial Effect Recognition Test web application presents participants with a range of photographs from Ekman and Friesen series of Pictures of Facial Affect (Ekman & Friesen, 1976), and their task is to identify the emotions expressed by the individuals in the photos.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

A psychology student asked me to develop this web application for her masterâ€™s thesis. The goal was to simplify the administration of the Facial Effect Recognition Test for psychology students. By digitizing the test, I aimed to eliminate the need for manual recording of the results and their analysis, making the process more efficient and user-friendly.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start For Developers

First go to your projects folder and clone the repository by running this command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/fardinkashef/EF-test.git
```

The app was previously developed using React for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end, so there are two folders named "front-end" and "back-end" which you can ignore completely. Recently, I re-developed this web app using Next.js, and you can see a folder named "NextJSVersion". So, first change your directory to this folder:

```
cd EF-test/NextJSVersion
```

So you're in Next.js version project. Now install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Now run this command to start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Finally open your browser and navigate to this URL to visit the website:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
